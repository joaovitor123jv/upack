# upack
#### A script for the lazy ones who do not want to learn how to use the package installation tool provided by their linux distribution


1. To use it, clone the repository with:
  `git clone https://github.com/joaovitor123jv/upack`

2. then go to the clond directory:
  `cd upack`
  
3. then run it with:
  `./upack`
  
  
If upack can't run, you probably will need to install ruby interpreter...
  * On Debian/Ubuntu:
    `sudo apt install ruby`
  * On Arch/Manjaro
    `sudo pacman -S ruby`
    
    
This is the first of the first commits, so... this have almost no utility ^^
