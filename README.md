# upack
A script for the lazy ones who do not want to learn how to use the package installation tool provided by their linux distribution


To use it, clone the repository with:
  git clone https://github.com/joaovitor123jv/upack

then go to the clond directory:
  cd upack
  
then run it with:
  ./upack
  
  
If upack can't run, you probably will need to install ruby interpreter...
  On Debian/Ubuntu:
    sudo apt install ruby
  On Arch/Manjaro
    sudo pacman -S ruby
    
    
This is the first of the first commits, so... this have almost no utility ^^
